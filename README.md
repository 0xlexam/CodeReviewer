This repository hosts a Node.js server, meticulously crafted using TypeScript and the Express framework, designed to facilitate the management of API requests in a code review and collaboration environment. Our server supports a variety of operations, including the submission of code, retrieval of submissions, posting comments, and orchestrating review sessions. With an emphasis on RESTful design principles, we ensure that all endpoints offer secure, efficient, and intuitive interactions for frontend clients, thereby streamlining the collaborative coding review process and enhancing developer productivity.
